This data represents the counties in Alabama with the highest mortality rates due to heart disease. 
These regions, often rural or socioeconomically disadvantaged, face higher health risks and challenges in accessing care, which contribute to these elevated mortality rates.
For more detailed information, refer to the [CDCâ€™s Interactive Atlas](https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/maps/national_maps/hd_all.htm).

These counties, located in the Black Belt region and other rural areas, often show higher heart disease mortality due to socioeconomic factors and limited access to healthcare facilities.
